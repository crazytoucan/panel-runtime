The point of this library was to allow programming sufficiently complex user interfaces
that:

1. Allow technical users to open/close various panels to allow them to fluidly
    dive into different workflows
2. Allow technical users to customize their interface to fit their needs, such as
    expanding/shrinking panels and columns to dice the appropriate screen real estate
3. Allow smooth drag-and-drop of panels between groups to further optimize their workflows

However, I am thinking about abandoning this effort because, essentially, I think the user groups I need to be targeting are less technical.

## Further reflection

After further reflection, I think a promising application development model is:

1. The "kitchen-sink" application for power users and sysadmins. This application type DOES promote workflow-switching and broader investigations
2. The "specialized" applications that target exact user groups. These are "views" that hone into only one of the many workflows
